One of the funny things peo­ple don’t real­ize is that there are two com­pletely dif­fer­ent com­pet­ing schools of thought when it comes to sta­tis­tics. Most peo­ple are famil­iar with fre­quen­tist sta­tis­tics, hav­ing dealt with things like nor­mal dis­tri­b­u­tion, bell curves, and estab­lished prob­a­bil­i­ties. The other school, Bayesian sta­tis­tics, is a realm that fewer peo­ple are famil­iar with, but just as applic­a­ble. In fact, the move over the last few years is for more peo­ple to change from the fre­quen­tist model to Bayesian techniques."
