Economists had expected April's manufacturing output to grow by 4 per cent on-year and 0.6 per cent over the previous month.

Instead, Singapore's industrial production dropped 0.3 per cent in April on-year, and contracted 3.5 per cent on a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis.

The Economic Development Board said the drop in manufacturing output was mainly due to a 12.5 per cent year-on-year decline in the electronics sector. While data storage continued to expand, other electronics segments remained weak.

Output from the biomedical manufacturing cluster also fell 4.2 per cent in April. While the medical technology segment expanded 15.9 per cent in April because of higher export demand, this was outweighed by a 7.6 per cent decline in pharmaceuticals production.

Meanwhile, the transport engineering cluster expanded 29.1 per cent year-on-year, led mainly by growth from the marine and offshore engineering segment.

The precision engineering cluster increased 2.7 per cent, while output of the general manufacturing cluster grew 2.0 per cent year-on-year in April.

The chemicals cluster also grew 1.1 per cent year-on-year. The petroleum and petrochemical segments posted gains, but output from the specialties and other chemicals segments declined due to poor demand from the region.

While the global economic turmoil continues to affect the manufacturing sector, analysts are hopeful that production will pick up in the coming months.

Song Seng Wun, regional economist, CIMB Research, said: "Tech drag is likely to lessen in the next couple of months especially as we head into the second half.

"Unless we see further fall in drug manufacturing, the smaller drag from tech, sustained output from transport engineering plus hopefully stable output from medical cluster could see overall manufacturing return to positive territory in the second quarter, we are looking at around 2-3 per cent growth year-on-year, after that 1 per cent contraction in the first quarter itself."
