SINGAPORE: It is Cooling-off Day for the Hougang By-Election on Friday.

In the past nine days of campaigning, both candidates from the People's Action Party and the Workers' Party have focussed on house visits followed by a series of public rallies.

But Friday is a day for voters of the single seat ward to reflect on the arguments posed by both sides before they head to the polls on Saturday to choose their next Member of Parliament.

No election meetings are allowed on Cooling-off Day.

The People's Action Party has fielded trade unionist Desmond Choo as its candidate for the second time, while the Workers' Party has fielded businessman Png Eng Huat, who was part of its East Coast GRC team in the 2011 General Election.

There are 23,368 eligible voters in the Hougang by-election. There will also be overseas voting.

A total of 43 overseas Singaporeans will vote in eight cities, such as Canberra, San Francisco, Tokyo and Hong Kong.

On Polling Day, which is Saturday, nine voting centres will open at 8am. Polling Day for the Hougang by-election is not a public holiday. Counting of votes will begin after polls close at 8pm.

The Workers' Party has held the Hougang seat since 1991.

In the 2011 General Election, the Workers' Party polled 14,850 votes against the PAP's 8,065 votes.
