I’m spending so much time designing, working and recovering (shoulder surgery ouch) that there’s less and less time to blog right now. However I’m reading and researching more than ever.

I get through a ton of articles each week and try to absorb all the interesting stuff so I thought that this might be a good opportunity to put everything I’ve enjoyed and found worthwhile into a newsletter so that hopefully you might find it useful too.

The content of newsletter is a real mix of mobile, social, tech, creativity and design from around the web. It’s stuff that gets me thinking and helps form ideas and inspire.

I started the newsletter in November and it now has 184 subscribers which is great because I’ve really enjoyed curating them.

Newsletters are sent roughly once every 2 weeks.

Cheers!
