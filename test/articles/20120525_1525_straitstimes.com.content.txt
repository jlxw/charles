The People's Action Party (PAP) ended its campaign in Hougang on Thursday with a call for change in the ward, urging voters to start afresh with its young candidate.

'Hougang, let's turn over a new page and start again,' declared party chairman Khaw Boon Wan at the PAP's final rally of the by-election on Thursday night.

With the ward in opposition hands since 1991, Hougang residents had been adversely affected, said Mr Khaw.
